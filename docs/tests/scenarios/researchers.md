# Researcher Scenarios

Graasp Desktop now connects teachers and students, they can both access to a common course support and share data between them. How about collecting these data in a larger scale, using them for tracking activity and improving digital education? With this mindset, a fourth stakeholder is included: Researchers. These will not use Graasp Desktop directly, but will receive data from the users and/or the teacher. We write down some imaginary cases where such information can be shared:

### Email (currently possible solution)

**Summary**: To share their data with the researchers, the students and/or the teacher exports their spaceâ€™s data and send them to involved researchers.

### Share button

**Summary**: To avoid using an external tool to share their information, the app would provide a share button. This might let the user choose between sending its data anonymously or not, and the receivers (himself, the teacher, the researcher). This button would be available for all spaces (saved or not) in Grassp Desktop.

### Share Actions

**Summary**: For a more automatic process of sharing data, Grassp desktop would save activity traces and send them to the Graasp API, anonymously or not, depending on some settings. The researcher would further have access to an external platform to display and visualize all the received data.
