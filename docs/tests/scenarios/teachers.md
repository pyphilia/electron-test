# Teacher Scenarios

### Preparing Class for Offline Use While Online

**Summary**: A teacher will visit a space that she has prepared on the Graasp authoring platform. She first visits the space with the link, browses through the preview version and then saves it to the desktop app. While checking that everything is working she notices that something is missing. She goes on the authoring platform to make the required changes (not tested) and then syncs the space within the desktop app. She finishes testing and then clears the input to ensure that she exports a clean version of the space. She can now load the space into another computer and test to see if the space works (we test this by deleting the space locally and loading it on the same computer).

### Correcting students’ answers

**Summary**: To provide feedbacks to the students, the teacher received all the students’ space data. She needs to visualize all of them on Graasp Desktop to access their space and data. To this aim, she imports a first space from a zip file to her saved spaces. She reads it and notes on a paper sheet the correction (not tested). Once she reviewed all the answers, she deletes the space and imports another student’s data.

**Steps:**

1. Open Graasp Desktop
2. Click on **Load**
3. Click on the **Browse** button and choose Aline space
4. Click on the **Load** button
5. Click on **Saved Spaces**
6. Click on Aline space

_Note_: This process does not take into account any dedicated feature for providing feedback to students. This is the general case where students provide their spaces and the professor gives a feedback in person (without the application).
